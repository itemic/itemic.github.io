Hey there. I'm Terran, a third-year Software Engineering student at the University of Auckland. I enjoy learning new things, making new things, and _I need something else that ends in things to complete the [rule of threes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_(writing))_ things.

What am I doing right now?
- Updating this site
- University coursework
- Learning Japanese (in hiatus)

I don't actually know how to write blurbs about myself, so check out [GitHub](https://www.github.com/itemic) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/terrankroft/) to learn more! I'll return and update this in due time.

			<h4>University of Auckland (2015-2018)</h4>

We organize and host events for SE students, such as board game nights, career evenings (Industry Night), as well as grad series talks. In 2017, I was also a general exec member.</p>
			<p><span class="vibrant">I was also the Part 4 Software Engineering Rep.</span> The <a class="bg" href="http://www.ece.auckland.ac.nz/en/about/our-department/sscc.html">Staff-Student Consultative Committee</a> is a way for students to raise issues within the Department. We also hold department-wide events from time to time.</p>
